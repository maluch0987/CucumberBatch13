-- Cucumber encourages code re-usability concept

main folder in navigation tree is used for writing code to develop the application.
We are not developers so we can delete this folder.

1. write code to develop the application - done in main folder
2. the code we write to test the application - done by testers.
to test the application,we write under test

2 things we have in every project
-coding-java
-non-java

coding will be at one place
non java will be at another place
--to write gherkin scenarios,wd use feature files


Given user is navigate to HRM application
